This bug occurs when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) in Objective-C.  Imagine you have a class `MyObject` with a property `myValue`.  You observe changes to `myValue` in another class.  If `myValue` is changed directly, observation works fine, but if you use `setValue:forKey:` or other methods that trigger KVO indirectly, the observer might not be triggered or might be triggered multiple times unexpectedly. This can be due to improper implementation of `setValue:forKey:` or issues with the order of KVO notifications.
